###ticTacToe

A small game built with c for the terminal, I have used c's pointers to design
the large glyphs and board as an exercise in passing arrays as pointers, mapping
one array into another.

## Internationalization

    In order to play in other languages, you have to execute the new line in
    the terminal:
    
    ```
    LANGUAGE=<language_COUNTRY> ./Makefile
    ```
    
    For example, in spanish from Spain:
    
    ```
    LANGUAGE=es_ES ./Makefile
    ```
